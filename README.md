# Docker tutorial

This repository comes with the blog article [From Vagrant to Docker: How to use Docker for local web development](http://blog.osteel.me/posts/2015/12/18/from-vagrant-to-docker-how-to-use-docker-for-local-web-development.html "From Vagrant to Docker: How to use Docker for local web development"). Please refer to it for a full explanation.

It contains a basic LEMP stack running with Docker, intented to be used for local web development.

## Get started

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ "Install Docker Engine") on your machine.

Clone the project:

    $ git clone git@github.com:osteel/docker-tutorial.git

From the project root:

    $ docker-compose up -d

Get the Docker Machine IP:

    $ docker-machine ip default

Access it from your browser.

Or use "make" command to run the same two commands above:

    $ make dockerup
    $ make dockerip


## Description

The different containers are described in [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/osteel/docker-tutorial/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

There are 6 of them:

 - a container for Nginx
 - a container for PHP-FPM
 - a container for MySQL
 - a container for phpMyAdmin
 - a container to make MySQL data persistent
 - a container for the application code

All of them are using official images.

When building and starting containers for the first time with Docker Compose, a database named `project` will be created by default. You can change this in [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/osteel/docker-tutorial/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

A [default Nginx configuration](https://github.com/osteel/docker-tutorial/blob/master/nginx/default.conf) is also copied over.

The current directory is mounted into the one served by Nginx on the container, so any update to the code is available without having to rebuild the container.

The MySQL data sits in its own directory mounted into its own container to make it persistent.

The application is available on the port 80 of the host machine.

phpMyAdmin is available on port 8080.
