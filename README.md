# Docker for local web development, part 3: a three-tier architecture with frameworks

This repository accompanies a [tutorial series](https://tech.osteel.me/posts/docker-for-local-web-development-why-should-you-care "Docker for local web development, introduction: why should you care?") about leveraging Docker for local web development.

The current branch covers part 3 of the series, which is about managing a three-tier architecture with frameworks. Please refer to the [full article](https://tech.osteel.me/posts/docker-for-local-web-development-part-3-a-three-tier-architecture-with-frameworks "Docker for local web development, part 3: a three-tier architecture with frameworks") for a detailed explanation.

## Content

This branch contains a [three-tier architecture](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24649/three-tier-architecture) application running on a LEMP stack, supported by Docker and orchestrated by Docker Compose.

It includes:

* A container for Nginx;
* A container for the backend application (based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/));
* A container for the frontend application (based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/));
* A container for MySQL;
* A container for phpMyAdmin;
* A volume to persist MySQL data.

The containers are based on Alpine images when available, for an optimised size.

## Prerequisites

Make sure [Docker Desktop for Mac or PC](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is installed and running, or head [over here](https://docs.docker.com/install/) if you are a Linux user. You will also need a terminal running [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

This setup also uses localhost's port 80, so make sure it is available.

## Directions of use

Add the following domains to your machine's `hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1 backend.demo.test frontend.demo.test phpmyadmin.demo.test
```

Clone the repository and `checkout` the `part-3` branch:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:osteel/docker-tutorial.git && cd docker-tutorial
$ git checkout part-3
```

**The rest of the commands are to be run from the root of the project.**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, both at the root of the project and in `src/backend`:

```
$ cp .env.example .env && cd src/backend && cp .env.example .env && cd ../..
```

The following commands may take a little bit of time, as some Docker images might need downloading.

Install the backend dependencies:

```
$ docker-compose run --rm backend composer install
```

Install the frontend dependencies:

```
$ docker-compose run --rm frontend yarn install
```

Start the project:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Once the project is started, generate the Laravel application's key:

```
$ docker-compose exec backend php artisan key:generate
```

You can now visit [frontend.demo.test](http://frontend.demo.test) and [backend.demo.test](http://backend.demo.test).

Yarn, Artisan and Composer are now directly available from the running containers:

```
$ docker-compose exec frontend yarn
$ docker-compose exec backend php artisan
$ docker-compose exec backend composer
```

For example, you could run Laravel's default database migrations to confirm the MySQL connection is working:

```
$ docker-compose exec backend php artisan migrate
```

## Explanation

The images used by the setup are listed and configured in [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/osteel/docker-tutorial/blob/part-3/docker-compose.yml).

When building and starting the containers based on the images for the first time, a MySQL database named `demo` is automatically created (you can pick a different name in the MySQL service's description in `docker-compose.yml`).

Minimalist Nginx configurations for the [backend application](https://github.com/osteel/docker-tutorial/blob/part-3/.docker/nginx/conf.d/backend.conf), the [frontend application](https://github.com/osteel/docker-tutorial/blob/part-3/.docker/nginx/conf.d/frontend.conf) and [phpMyAdmin](https://github.com/osteel/docker-tutorial/blob/part-3/.docker/nginx/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf) are also copied over to Nginx's container, making them available at [backend.demo.test](http://backend.demo.test), [frontend.demo.test](http://frontend.demo.test) and [phpmyadmin.test](http://phpmyadmin.test) respectively (the database credentials are *root* / *root*).

The directories containing the backend and frontend applications are mounted onto both Nginx's and the applications' containers, meaning any update to the code is immediately available upon refreshing the page, without having to rebuild any container.

Moreover, the Vue.js development server is automatically started, meaning you can update the code and benefit from _hot-reload_ straight away.

The frontend application is consuming a simple endpoint from the backend application to fetch and display the text below the animated gif.

Finally, the database data is persisted in its own local directory through the volume `mysqldata`, which is mounted onto MySQL's container.

## Cleaning up

To stop the containers:

```
$ docker-compose stop
```

To destroy the containers:

```
$ docker-compose down
```

To destroy the containers and the associated volumes:

```
$ docker-compose down -v
```

To remove everything, including images and orphan containers:

```
$ docker-compose down -v --rmi all --remove-orphans
```
